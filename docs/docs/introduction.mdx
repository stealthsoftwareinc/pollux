# Introduction

Pollux provides tools for orchestrating various secure multi-party
computation (MPC) systems.
MPC is a general paradigm that enables accurate analytics on private
data from multiple sources and derives its security through mathematical
cryptography.
It differs from, but can be combined with, other privacy approaches such
as trusted hardware or differential privacy.
An example of an MPC system is
[Divvi Up](https://divviup.org/),
which is a privacy-respecting telemetry service developed by the
[Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)](https://abetterinternet.org/).

In general, the tools provided by Pollux consist of
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
files,
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
files, and helper shell scripts.
The Docker Compose files provide the fundamental ability to deploy the
MPC system's components on any Docker-enabled machine, the Terraform
files allow the deployments to be hosted on cloud machines, and the
helper shell scripts make it easier to configure certain parts of the
deployment.
